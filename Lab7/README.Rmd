The data in this lab is from the [Spotify Song Attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification) data set in Kaggle. This data set contains song characteristics of 2017 songs played by a single user and whether or not he liked the song. Since this dataset contains the song preferences of a single user, the scope of the analysis is limited to this particular user.

The  [Spotify documentation page](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/) contains a description of the variables included in this dataset.

We conducted logistic regression, model selection, and model diagnoses on the dataset.
