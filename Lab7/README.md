The data in this lab is from the [Spotify Song
Attributes](https://www.kaggle.com/geomack/spotifyclassification) data
set in Kaggle. This data set contains song characteristics of 2017 songs
played by a single user and whether or not he liked the song. Since this
dataset contains the song preferences of a single user, the scope of the
analysis is limited to this particular user.

The [Spotify documentation
page](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/tracks/get-audio-features/)
contains a description of the variables included in this dataset.

We conducted logistic regression, model selection, and model diagnoses
on the dataset.
